# pnpm settings for dependency resolution
#
# auto-install-peers: Automatically install peer dependencies when installing packages.
# Required because many packages (react-markdown, rehype-*, @anthropic-ai/sdk, TensorFlow.js)
# declare peer deps but don't include them as direct dependencies. Without this, you'd get
# warnings and need to manually add peer deps. Default in pnpm 7+, but explicit for clarity.
auto-install-peers=true

# strict-peer-dependencies: When false, pnpm won't fail installation on peer dep version conflicts.
# Required for this project because:
# - React ecosystem packages often have conflicting peer dep ranges (React 17 vs 18)
# - TensorFlow.js packages may have mismatched peer dep versions
# - Some older packages require exact peer dep versions that conflict with newer packages
# Note: legacy-peer-deps is an npm-only setting and has no effect in pnpm.
strict-peer-dependencies=false

- Idea of agent generated in-chat applet (game of life), tetris
 - replies (instruction for re-generate)
 - re-generate (goal)
 - message versioning (store past generations)

- voice

- add ability to investigate Jarvis issue using combination of AI, description, file upload (screenshot) and diagnostic log -> is this a skill? Maybe prototype the Skill to run well in Claude Code, then have it run here?

- web crawler with specialist agent + tool (already have scrape, but need link extraction)

Consider:
- Hook / Guardrail - before / post LLM, before / post tool use - no demand yet

Won't do:
- A2A - too early, nothing useful to connect to
